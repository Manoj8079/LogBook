# LogBook



## Introduction
LogBook is made to manage staff members in an organisation and to give a quick overview of their daily duties. The administrator may use this information to add or delete employees from their organisation and to monitor their productivity. Employees can add their daily activities to the LogBook and view their performance data as pie and bar charts on the dashboard. An employee can, however, also edit his or her profile. LogBook essentially gives you the ability to manage your staff whenever you want. Employee time monitoring is one of LogBook's key features. This helps you save time and money.

## Purpose of LogBook
Employees at businesses and technical institutes set aside a significant amount of time, either in the workplace or at home, to prepare their daily, weekly, and other records. Using LogBook, employees and management may quickly create records since they have access to the information at their fingertips.
